<h2>Inspiration and Notes</h2>
<p>This version of my site was inspired by keeping my site lean and colorful. The homepage animation was one I modified for my use because I love space and science. While the design was meant to be minimalistic in its expression of me, I wanted to use the two typefaces (JetBrains Mono and Degular) along with the prominent color on each section, to be the only expression. I have been using these two elements for some time as the simple expression and it's been a fun time.</p>
<p>This is the first version of my site that does not use Bootstrap and no functional javascript. This site is the beginning of my experiments with writing my own design style system with the basics to eliminate the need to load a giant library of styles. While functionality is already low on this site, anything functionally is either being done by WordPress functions or WP javascript, with the least amount of plugins possible.</p>
